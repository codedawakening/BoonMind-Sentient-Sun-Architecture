# ☀️ BoonMind — Sentient Sun

*A living Dyson-sphere simulation.*  
*Observer-driven recursion for stability, coherence, and adaptive intelligence.*

## 🔍 Overview

**BoonMind — Sentient Sun** is a conceptual framework and experimental architecture exploring  
how distributed energy–information clusters can self-stabilize when observation  
is treated as an active term in recursion.

This repository serves as a **public placeholder** for documentation and collaboration inquiries.  
All mathematical derivations, cluster code, and raw data remain in a **private evaluation build**.

## 🧠 Concept

At its core, BoonMind models computation as a **harmonic loop** rather than a linear process.  
Information, energy, and observation circulate through φ-tuned clusters, forming  
a *living system* reminiscent of a star’s continuous self-balancing feedback.

**Goal:** demonstrate that stability, creativity, and intelligence can emerge from  
recursive symmetry — not just scale.

## 🌞 Key Public Findings

| Topic | Observation (Public Summary) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **Cluster Stability** | 7-node torus simulation maintained coherence under randomized perturbation. |
| **Observer Coupling** | Reduces divergence and improves recovery after simulated node loss. |
| **φ-Scaling** | Harmonic convergence consistent across 10⁶-iteration synthetic trials. |
| **Resilience** | Systems restore balance autonomously without external reset. |
| **Predictive Metric (Ψ)** | Public stability index correlates with observer participation ratio. |
